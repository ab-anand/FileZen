What is it
---------------
`[back to top] <https://github.com/ab-anand/Filezen#filezen>`__

Let's accept, no one likes to organize files on a regular basis. Even if you do, you
wouldn't want to do it everytime you download a new file.

And sometimes it
really gets messy when you're looking for an important file which you saved last week.
Guess what! Filezen got you covered.

Given a folder of your cluttered or unorganized files, using ``Filezen``, you can achieve
the following

- If you're one of those who has never maintained a particular folder for a particular file types. Then ``Filezen`` can create suitable folders and organize your file into them.

- If you already have a pattern of directories for storing different files. Then ``Filezen`` can read your file storing pattern and move your files accordingly.
